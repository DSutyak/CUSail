CU Sail
Cornell University Autonomous Sailboat Team
Navigation Project

The enclosed files contain the following elments of the navigation system of SailVane

-Arduino Individual Code: This folder contains sensor code for the boat's Rotary Sensor, IMU and GPS
-Sail and Tailvane Servo Testing Code: This folder contains code to calibrate the sail and tailvane servos
-Simulators: This folder contains two kinds of MATLAB simulators made for testing the algorithm
-Short Term Navigation Algorithm: This folder contains code in C that evwntually populates the function, 
								  nShort() in the Arduino Code
-Arduino Navigation Code: This folder contains code that is uploaded to the microcontroler, and is 
						  the culmination of the sensor code and the navigation algorithm.
