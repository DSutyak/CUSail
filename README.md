#Cornell University Autonomous Sailboat Team
#Navigation Project

The enclosed files contain the following elments of the navigation system of SailVane

-Arduino Individual Code: This folder contains sensor code for the boat's Rotary Sensor, IMU and GPS

-Simulators: This folder contains two kinds of MATLAB simulators made for testing the algorithm

-Short Term Navigation Algorithm: This folder contains code in C that eventually populates the 
				  function, nShort() in the Arduino Code
								  
-Arduino Navigation Code: This folder contains code that is uploaded to the microcontroler, and is
                          the culmination of the sensor code and the navigation algorithm
			  
-Individual Functions for Arduino Code: Contains (mostly) helper functions used in the Arduino Code

#Recent Updates (10/6/16)

-Added the most curretn version of the algorithm to the Short Term Navigation Algorithm folder
-Added the most curretn version of the arduino code to the Arduino Navigation Code folder
