 ShortTermNavigation
  The primary file that schedules tasks for SailVane: 

  0. Initialization
  1. Obtain Rotary Sensor data
  2. Obtain GPS data
  3. Obtain IMU data
  4. Obtain appropriate sail angle and tailvane angles
  5. Set servos to obtained sail and tailvane angles 
  6. Go to 1.

 Code has been tested and run on an Arduino Due

// Code within setup() runs once on receiving power
void setup() {
  initSensors(); // Run setup code for all sensors
  initNavigation(); // Set the number of waypoints and the current waypoint # to 0
  initServos(); // attach the sail and tailvane servos
  setWaypoints(); // create the course by means of a waypoint array
}

// Code within loop() runs after setup and runs constantly (in order) while the mircrocontroller is powered
void loop() {
  sRSensor(); //Gather wind directio w.r.t North
  sGPS(); //Gather global coordinates
  sIMU(); //Gather boat direction w.r.t North, Roll and Pitch
  nShort(); //Run Short Term Navigation Algorithm to obtain servo commands
  nServos(); //Send acquired servo commands
  updateTime(); //Update @milTime with miliseconds since program started
